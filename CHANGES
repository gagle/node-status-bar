v2.0.1 (27 Feb 2014)
  Fixed size calculation for file size bigger than 2^31 bytes (2GB).

v2.0.0 (20 Feb 2014)
  Removed "update()". It was stupid because you can do the same with "write()"
    because the bar is a writable stream. This implies that you cannot update
    the bar with a number, you need to pass the chunk to the "write()" function.
  Fixed the cumulative length when writing objects with zero length.
  Replaced the "render" and "finish" callbacks by events.
  Added "hangup" event.
  When the size was 0 the "finish" callback was not triggered.
  Improved current speed with up to 3 smoothing factors.
  Improved the estimated remaining time. It now uses the average speed rather
    than the current speed.

v1.1.1 (02 Jan 2014)
  Fixed the "format.time()" function when the remaining time was higher than an
    hour and a day.

v1.1.0 (24 Dec 2013)
  The default formatting functions are now accessible throw the pointer "this".
  Added a new formatting function "progressBar".
  Removed "progressBar" stat.

v1.0.0 (19 Dec 2013)
  Improved speed calculation with an exponential moving average. The speed
      should be more stable without losing too much accuracy.
  All the stats now contain raw data. The "stats" property has been removed. It
    is now returned as an argument of the "render" function.
  Added transfer hang up handling.
  Added formatting functions.
  Added support for unpipe events. Now the timer is cancelled when the user
    unpipes the stream.
  Set a default frequency update of 200ms. The frequency cannot be null or 0.
  The "render" function is now mandatory.
  Renamed options:
    "write" to "render".
    "barCompletion" to "progressBarComplete".
    "barIncompletion" to "progressBarIncomplete".
    "barLength" to "progressBarLength".
  Renamed stats:
    "eta" stat to "remainingTime".
    "progress" to "progressBar".
    "total" to "totalSize".
    "current" to "currentSize".
  Added stats:
    "elapsedTime".
    "remainingSize".
  Renamed "clearInterval()" to "cancel()".
  Minor bugfixes and improvements.

v0.0.2 (07 Dec 2013)
  Added "current" and "total" stats.
